				<p>
					The first Dutch Magento Unconference is here.
					After the success of the <a href="http://www.mageunconference.org/">2 unconferences in Berlin</a>
					we're bringing this awesome event to the Netherlands. - Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/mageucnl">Twitter</a> for more updates.

				<h2>What's an unconference?</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Well, there are talks, a location and people coming together to listen to those talks but that's about where the similarities end.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					An unconference is all about sharing knowledge and socializing. There are no speakers and no pre-determined talks. The program as made on the spot
					by writing your talk- or discussion idea on a piece of paper after which we'll all vote on the best talks.
				</p>
				<p>
					With 4 rooms and 4 time slots that means 16 talks on both the Saturday and Sunday. In between those talks we'll have coffee breaks and a lunch. We'll
					make sure there is enough time to socialize, discuss talks and meetup with friends.
				</p>
				<br/><br/>
				<h2>For who is the unconference?</h2>
				<p>
					We're aiming to attract a wide audience. With both technical and non-technical subjects like marketing and conversion optimization or team management techniques
					at previous events it made it interesting for anyone working with Magento.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not used to speaking? This event is perfect to get some experience. With no expectations and an open and welcoming atmosphere you can try out a new talk idea
					or just bring up a subject you are passionate about.
